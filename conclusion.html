                        <p>While no arugment is 100% rock solid the I would state that the evidence that we have at hand in Josephs favor.</p>
                        <p>From what can tell from relevant account its clear that Joseph did not attempt a full on divine translation of the Kinderhook plates like he did with the Book of Abraham or Book of Mormon. From the looks of it Joseph just put in some good old elbow grese and gave a secular try at translation which wasn't anything new for him. 
                           The fact that there was never anything offically published by the Church stating this as a revelation as well as the fact Joseph seemed to loose interest in the plates after this partial translation points to the fact that this want to important to him. </p>
                        <p>In my personal opinion I figure that Joseph probably tried to recieve revelation regarding the plates and either got nothing or was told by the Lord to move on with more important things. </p>
                        <p>We learn many important lessons from this unique piece of church history, first of all being the fact Joseph was a normal person like you and me. He's allowed to hit the books and attempt translation the normal way and secondly that secondary questions are not going to give the answers to our burining spirital questions about the restoration.</p>
                        <p>To quote Lawrence G. Corbridge of the seventy: "You cannot prove the Church is true by disproving every claim made against it. That will never work. It is a flawed strategy. Ultimately there has to be affirmative proof, and with the things of God, affirmative proof finally and surely comes by revelation through the spirit and power of the Holy Ghost."</p>
                        <p>Even though listening to arguments like the one I gave today can give us temporary affirmation regarding the truthfulness of the restoration there will always be another scandle to overcome. The only way to have a testimony that will never be shaken it to have it confirmed by the power of the Holy Ghost as Elder Corbrige stated.</p>
                        <p>I testify of prophetic calling of Joseph Smith and of the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ here on the earth. God speaks to us today and I know that if we pray, listen, and do our part to study it out in our minds that He will give up relevation upon revelation and soften even our strongest doubts. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen </p>
