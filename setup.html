                        <p>On April 16th 1843 a man by the name of Robert Wiley began excavating what were thought to be indian burial grounds about 55 milies south of Nauvoo Illinois in the town of Kinderhook. After breaking apart a substancial ammount of rock the group, lead by Robert, came accross brunt skeleton remains. Within these remains they found 6 small brass plates with unknown engravings covering both sides over every plate.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Setup_photo_kinderhook.avif" alt="Photo of the Kinderhook Plates" /></a>
                        <p>Robert, having heard of Joseph Smith's ability to interpect and translate text, brought the plates to Joseph in hopes that he would translate them.</p>
                        <p>We have little evidence of the interaction between Robert and the church leaders in Nauvoo. However, after the saints entered the Salt Lake valley they published the History of the Church which contained the following quote: </p>
                        <p>“I have translated a portion of them, and find they contain the history of the person with whom they were found. He was a descendant of Ham, through the loins of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and that he received his kingdom from the ruler of heaven and earth.”</p>
                        <p>This sparked quite the excitment in the area and lead to lots of people claiming that these plates were conclusive edividence in favor of the Book of Mormon. </p>
                        <p> Aside from this no other offical church publication was made on the issue and Joseph never publically claimed to have recieved revelation on the matter.</p>
